# covid-tracker
 Covid Tracker app with Spring Boot
  The bulk add/modify Covid patients and Vaccinated People features are ready. 
  Tests can be run using the CSV files beyond the resources folders. 
  Only CSV files are taken into account by this release.
  I also put the collection of tests I used with Postman in that folder.
  Get report is available with pagination support per day, month or year per country
  Updates were made to use DTOs instead of entities while fetching results from the DB
  Commented code was removed and tests was fully made with updated CSV files
  The introduction of a service interface was added as well as its implementation
